"""
Model Training Pipeline
=======================
This script trains the baseline Logistic Regression model for employee attrition prediction.
It integrates with the data_preprocessing module, evaluates basic accuracy, and serializes
the resulting model and scaler artifacts for use in the Flask web application.
