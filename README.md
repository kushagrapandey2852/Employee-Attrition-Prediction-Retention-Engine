## 🚀 Project Overview
RetentionAI transforms raw HR metrics into clear, actionable intelligence. It utilizes an **88% accurate** Logistic Regression machine learning model integrated into a meticulously designed, beautiful Flask web interface. The system identifies high-risk employees instantly and suggests tailored retention strategies based on individual risk drivers.

## ✨ Key Features
- 🧠 **Precision Machine Learning**: Achieves an **88% baseline accuracy** (93% F1-score for retention) trained on rigorous IBM HR Analytics data.
- 💎 **Premium Web Dashboard**: A stunning, modern UI built with custom CSS, glassmorphism, responsive data grids, and smooth animations.
- 🎯 **Individual Assessments**: Predict a single employee's risk instantly by inputting metrics directly into the aesthetic form.
- 🗂️ **Batch Processing Engine**: Upload organizational `.csv` rosters to dynamically rank hundreds of employees by attrition probability.
- 📊 **Executive Dashboard**: A sleek high-level overview detailing aggregate risk distributions and systemic organizational drivers.

## ⚙️ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrRenntech/AI-Employee-Retention.git
cd AI-Employee-Retention
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Model Training (First Run)
Before booting the dashboard, compile the machine learning artifacts:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```
*(Generates the serialized model and scaler securely in the `/models` directory).*

### 3. Launching the App
Start the Flask web server:
```bash
python app/app.py
```
🌐 **Open your browser and navigate to:** [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

## 💡 How It Works
- **Data Preprocessing**: Categorical features are encoded and numerical features scaled via `StandardScaler` to ensure optimal gradient descent.
- **Explainability**: The system unpacks model coefficients to pinpoint exactly *why* a specific employee might leave (e.g., *Compensation*, *Distance from Home*, or *Environment Satisfaction*).
